This is the official repository of all things related to cavefolder, the now-defunct show about Andy and Bulb. There's a .txt file in each folder that briefly describes how to use each asset to recreate the show. 

**Hit the big green download button at the top (Code -> Download .ZIP) to download these files, or click "Download" on an individual file to only grab what you need.**

DISCLAIMER: This page is only meant to archive the original files from the show, not provide free assistance or tutorials to making new cavefolder-based works. I do not owe you tech support or tutorials by sharing these files. If you contact me with questions, I'll help you to the best of my availability, but you're on your own for everything I can't or refuse to do.
