This is the official repository of all things related to cavefolder, the now-defunct show about Andy and Bulb. There's a .txt file in each folder that briefly describes how to use each asset to recreate the show. Hit the big green download button at the top to grab these files, or browse this page yourself to only grab what you need.

***Please be patient as I finish gathering all the 3D assets from the show and updating them to be compatible with the latest version of Blender 2.93.***
