This is the audio sample used to make Andy's voice. Simply import it into a sampler plugin in a DAW like Reaper or FL Studio and spam random keypresses to make Andy's voice.

2022 UPDATE: DO NOT TRY TO USE THIS MODEL, IT'S SO POORLY-MADE THAT IT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY CAVEFOLDER GOT CANCELLED. PLEASE USE THE .blend IN THE "MODELS" FOLDER INSTEAD. THANKS
The 3D model and animation file of Andy. Made in Blender 2.80 Beta but should work with version 2.93.5 and up. 
The animation is unfortunately stored in the Nonlinear Animation (NLA Editor) panel, and is very annoying to work with unless you convert the Action back into standard keyframes. Blame past wavetro for trying to use such a convoluted animation system.
