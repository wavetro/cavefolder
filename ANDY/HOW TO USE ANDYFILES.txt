- cf_Andy.blend
The 3D model and animation file of Andy. Works with Blender 2.93.5 and up. The animation is unfortunately stored in the Nonlinear Animation (NLA Editor) panel, and is very annoying to work with unless you convert the Action back into standard keyframes. Blame past wavetro for trying to use such a convoluted animation system.
