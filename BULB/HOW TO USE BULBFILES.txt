This is a giant image file of Bulb. No instructions needed

- Bulb.svg
This is the original vector file of Bulb. If you don't know how to use it, don't worry about it

- Bulb.flac
This is the audio sample used to make Bulb's voice. Simply import it into a sampler plugin in a DAW like Reaper or FL Studio and spam random keypresses to make Bulb's voice.

- cf_Bulb.blend
The 3D model and animation file of Bulb. Made in Blender 2.80 Beta but should work with version 2.93.5 and up. 
The animation is unfortunately stored in the Nonlinear Animation (NLA Editor) panel, and is very annoying to work with unless you convert the Action back into standard keyframes. Blame past wavetro for trying to use such a convoluted animation system.
