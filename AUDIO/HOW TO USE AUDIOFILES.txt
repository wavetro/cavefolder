This is the original audio of cavefolder, in all of its FLAC glory.

This is a screenshot of the Audacity project file that contains the five audio channels that make up the audio. I didn't share the original project files because the data would be a whopping 500 MB. 
I also don't agree with the telemetry decisions made by the new developers of Audacity 3.0.3 and above. Instead, I've exported the five audio channels into seperate FLAC stems.

These five stem files are all the sounds of cavefolder, isolated into individual tracks. It's largely comprised of CC0 sound effects from Freesound.org, save for Bulb's walking, which is just a recording of my keys jangling. 
A proper DAW like Reaper or FL Studio is required if you plan to recreate Andy's voice, Bulb's voice, or any music from cavefolder. Instructions to re-create the characters' voices can be found in the .txt file of their respectively-named "ANDY" and "BULB" folders. 
While full versions of the music do not exist, it is very easy to recreate them. I don't have the original MIDI notes, but the free VST plugin Helm by Matt Tytel (along with the factory presets) is all you need.
In Helm, open the preset browser and look for the "Pad" section under the factory presets. The music at 0:45 was "MT Pulsing Daisies" and at 3:15 was "COA Broken Old Analog." Playing random chords/notes with these presets will make it pretty clear how easy it is to recreate the songs from the video.
